#MongoDB uploading and Image Processing
This project was a way to test using [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com) and [multer](https://mongoosejs.com) to upload and read
files (in this case images) from a MongoDB.

###Image Processing
Using [get-image-colors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/get-image-colors), the five primary
colours of the given image are determined and outputted. Currently, every file in the database is
displayed everytime.
